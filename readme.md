1. Which lesson appears to attract the most traffic consistently across cohorts (per program)?
    - Javascript-I
3. Is there a cohort that referred to a lesson significantly more than other cohorts seemed to gloss over?
    - Javascript-I
5. Are there students who, when active, hardly access the curriculum? If so, what information do you have about these students?
    - These students were mostly in Web Dev. Of the bottom 25% of students, about 83% were Web Dev.
    - They usually accessed the curriculum a few number of times and never again.
    
4. Is there any suspicious activity, such as users/machines/etc accessing the curriculum who shouldnâ€™t be? Does it appear that any web-scraping is happening? Are there any suspicious IP addresses?
    - Users that have no cohort assigned tend to access the curriculum at a high rate of speed. This indicates web-scraping.
5. At some point in 2019, the ability for students and alumni to access both curriculums (web dev to ds, ds to web dev) should have been shut off. Do you see any evidence of that happening? Did it happen before?
    -September 8 and November 24. On both these days, there were no data science material accessed. Trying to compare it the other way around with DS students/alumni accessing Web Dev material leaves much to be desired when investigating. DS data does not start till September 29, so I am unable to compare it to the September 8 data for Web Dev. Also, DS students/alumni did not access any Web Dev material from Oct 06 to Dec 01.
   -It is possible that Data Science students never had access denied to Web Dev material.
   -It is possible that Web Dev had access cut off to them in September and November.
